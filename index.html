     My name is Jose Castellanos I am 22 and born and raised in the Bay Area. I have spent most of my life in Hayward and i think that theres no better place in the world than the Bay . 
     I have a huge interests in technology and motorcyles and i have about 5 years working in the automotive field so i guess i know a few things.  
     But Now i hope to transition into the technology sector. I believe that the world around us is changing so fast due to tech and i would like to play my part 
     in this revolution. I have always had an intrest in technology and now i hope to unlock my full potential with all that i will be learning at Uc Berkely Extension.
